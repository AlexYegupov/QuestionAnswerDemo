## p1

+: make beautiful css

fix: edit existing user, input 000 password (to produce server error), save => username is disappeared from breadcrumb

fix: redirect to create-user page BACK after logging in (see nextPathname)

+: improve algorithm: distinguish between "logged out" state (after logout) and "unknown log in state" (after page refresh)

+: add avatars (including default "unknown user" avatar)

+: add react-forms implementation

## p2
+: server 403 => force logout user on client

+: add "are you sure?" when exit edit form without saving

r: getUserError should return list of error, not string

+ activate user name input control initially

+: move setUtil to external module

+: multilanguage

+: add functional & rest-server tests

?: don't overwrite action payload completely by error response, save sent to server data somewhere in action. Maybe payload->req, ->response?


## At last:

try clone&check project

remove unneeded files & comments
